1. The clearing of Maſter Cranfords Text, 2 Tim. Chap. 2. verſ. 17. from that imputation of cruelty and un-goſpell bloodineſſe, which the ſaid Mr. Cranford (being the See the title page of Mr. Cranfords Sermon, he may feed B. la Bridewell, Nich. la Newgate, &c. If the fleſh of Chriſts Diſciples may be meat, and their blood tears, and groans drink, for ſuch places and inſtruments of cruelty. Inſtruments of Simeon and Levi brethren in iniquity, in whoſe habitations were and are inſtruments of cruelty; let not the ſoules of the Lords and Commons come into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly let not▪ my Lord Major, and Aldermen, and Citizens be united Curſed bee their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruell. I will divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael, Geneſ. 49. 5, 6, 7. feeder of Chriſtopher le Stocks, and minding it ſhould ſeem to fatten his charge) endevoured to faſten thereon, in a Sermon at Pauls, before the Lord Major, Aldermen, and citizens of London, contrary to the intent of the whole New Teſtament, though not without the ſuffrages of thoſe Fathers of his perſecuting ſpirit, the Greek and Latine Prelats (no better Fathers, nor of better authority to expound, much leſſe to pervert Scripture; the Dr. Andrews Biſhop of Wincheſter, Dr. Hall B. of Exeter and Norwich, Dr. Vſher B. of Armagh, &c. men of great reading and eloquence, as Mr. Cranfords Fathers were, and tainted with an unchriſtian ſpirit of prelaticall perſecution like them and him, hee is their very ſon; ſucceſſive hands have not been laid upon him and his brethren like minded, by their ſpirituall Fathers in vain. I ſpeak not againſt the perſons or parts of him or them. They, I hope, are ſaved through fire burning that ſtraw and ſtubble, and whatever painted pageantry they built upon the foundation Chriſt and him crucified. The like I wiſh to Mr. Cranford. It is the ſpirit of old Father Abaddon, that old Ebrew Father, and old Father Apollyon that moſt ancient Greek Father (Rev. 9. 11.) that I reſiſt▪ from whoſe net I pray Mr. Cranford may be delivered, if perhaps, the thoughts of his heart may be forgiven him, the bloody thoughts, and he as Saul a perſecutor may become Paul a perſecuted profeſſor of that way which he now ſubtilly oppoſes under the name of Hereſie.P. Lancelotus Wintonienſis, P. Joſephus Exonienſis, P. Jacobus Armacenſis. Theſe names in the Ages following may be as much abuſed, and as reverently handled to cheat withall, and to introduce Prelacy, as any Greek or Latine) together with thoſe anciently venerable Greek and Hebrew Grandſires, P. Abaddon, P. Satan, P Apollyon, P. Diabolus. That Text 2 Tim. 2. 17. is cleered from the ſaid falſe aſperſion by a jury of its Peeres, viz. twelve texts, three antecedent, and nine conſequent in the ſame Chapter, faithfull witneſſes and true, proclaiming aloud that ver. 17. is abuſed and falſely charged, as many otherwayes, ſo chiefly in that the compariſon of Hereticall opinions to a Gangrene or Canker intended only in point of ſpreading, is untruly urged in point of deading and cutting off by the Magiſtrates ſword▪ is falſly and wickedly, propounded as the mind of Chriſt, in ſtead of awaking by the word of the Miniſter. The Iury is 2 Tim. 2. chap. verſ. 14, 15, 16. 18, 19, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. juſt twelve faithfull expoſitors of the purpoſe of verſ. 17. falſly accuſed by Mr. Cranford.
